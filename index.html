            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a term 6 computer engineering student currently attending Memorial University of Newfoundland. 
                I have completed two previous engineering work terms with the companies Enginuity Inc. and STEMWorld educational services.
            </p>
            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>
                I'm passionate about sports and have had the privilege of playing with several basketball and soccer provincial teams during my upbringing. Additionally, I solo backpacked across Europe during the summer of 2023, exploring various countries and experiencing diverse cultures.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have a deep love for nature and adventure, which fuels my interest in hiking, camping, and backpacking. I've had the opportunity to embark on exciting backpacking journeys around the world, discovering the beauty of our planet's landscapes.<br>
                You can see the photos and videos I took during my travels on my Instagram:
